###  Features

Dart is a strictly typed programming language. It supports both AOT (Ahead of time) and JIT (Just In Time) compilation. It is a compiled programming language and can also transpile the code into JavaScript.

JIT compilation is used during development, using a compiler that is especially fast. Then, when an app is ready for release, it is compiled AOT. 

Dart can deliver the best of both worlds: extremely fast development cycles, and fast execution and startup times.

- `dart:core` library contains built-in types, collections, and other core functionality for every Dart program.
- `dart:core` library automatically imports to every Dart program.
- `Dart` is a single thread programming language like 'JavaScript'
